              <h2> A little bit about me. </h2>
              <div class = "half-width">
                <p> I am a web developer with a love for minimalistic design. Currently based in Lisbon, I am working my way through the Skillcrush curriculum by night and finishing up my degree in Intercultural Psychology by day.
                After I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work.  </p>
              </div>
              <div class = "half-width">
                <p>
                Now I'm working on making a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
                Whenever I am not coding, dancing or exploring the city, I like to relax with a good book and a cup of coffee. </p>

                <h3> Hand-Coded HTML </h3>
                <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read,
                easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

              <div class = "third-width">

                <h3> Well-Organized CSS </h3>
                <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
                  I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices. </p>

                <h3> Ease Converting Designs into Code </h3>
                <p> You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly
                  &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match. </p>
